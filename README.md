# FACEMASK-DETECTION-MODEL-USING-YOLOV5

## ABSTRACT

The ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives and economies worldwide, with social distancing and wearing masks in public recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and governments as critical measures to reduce transmission rates. However, compliance with mask mandates is often violated, highlighting the need for accessible and efficient face mask detection models to curb the spread of the disease. Using deep learning and computer vision, this project developed a real-time face mask detection model to identify individuals wearing masks and violators. Leveraging deep transfer learning concepts and the YOLOv4 algorithm, the model achieved 90% accuracy in detecting face masks in public spaces, with simulations conducted using Google Console. This project emphasizes the effectiveness of YOLOv4 and its parameters in building real-time face detection solutions, offering a robust tool to promote safety in public environments.

## INTRODUCTION

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant global disruption, with millions of deaths and a rapid spread through respiratory droplets and physical contact. Despite vaccination efforts, the risk of reinfection and slow population coverage necessitate continued safety measures like wearing masks, maintaining social distancing, and hygiene practices. However, widespread non-compliance with mask-wearing rules exacerbates the spread, as observed during India’s second wave. To address this, a Face Mask Detection system using Deep Transfer Learning was developed to identify violators in real-time and assist authorities in enforcing compliance. Leveraging advanced AI technologies, the project employs YOLOv4, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to build a model that achieves high accuracy with reduced computational complexity. By integrating pre-trained neural networks and computer vision, this solution highlights the transformative role of AI in combating the pandemic and supporting healthcare systems globally.
